                Fleetory was founded on genuine, hands-on experience in
                logistics — from handling dangerous goods and customs clearance
                to coordinating urgent shipments with tight deadlines. We
                understand the fast pace, narrow time windows, and pressures
                that come with moving goods quickly and safely across the UK.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Our expertise comes from working on both sides of the operation:
                managing freight, loading for road, air, and sea transport, and
                collaborating closely with drivers to ensure every job runs
                smoothly. We know what drivers experience daily, and we utilise
                that knowledge to make same-day courier work as efficient and
                stress-free as possible for everyone involved — especially our
                valued customers.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-12">
                We specialise in same-day and dedicated courier services, where
                your shipment is the only priority we handle from collection to
                delivery. We've assembled a carefully selected group of fully
                vetted, highly skilled drivers — many with years of experience
                working for leading companies like Amazon, DPD, Royal Mail, and
                Parcelforce — and combined that expertise with a comprehensive
                nationwide network of trusted couriers.
